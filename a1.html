      <p>Schematic: Three LEDs, red, yellow, and green, were used and each was connected to a resistor to make sure that the current is less than 20 mA.
        Red LED: pin 11
        Green LED: pin 12
        Yellow LED: pin 13
      </p>

      <p>Circuit:
        I used Ohm’s law to calculate the resistance of the resistor I should use:
        V=I*R
        
        Since the voltage drop for red,yellow,and greed LEDs are 1.8 V,
        5V-1.8V=20mA*R
        
        Since 1A=1000mA,
        R=3.2V/0.02A
        R=160Ω
        
        However, there is no 160 Ω resistor in the kit, so I chose to use the 220 Ω ones because the way to make the current to be less than 20 mA is to choose a resistor with a slightly greater resistance.

      <p>For each cycle, the red LED turns on first and waits for 0.5 second. 
        Then the green LED turns on and waits for 0.5 second. 
        While both the red and green LEDs are on, the yellow LED repeats the following steps for 5 times: it turns on, waits for 0.1 second, turns off, and waits for 0.1 second. 
        After that, the red LED turns off and wait for 0.5 second. 
        Then the greed LED turns off and wait for 0.5 second.
